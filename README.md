A Repository for exploring pure Java.

## Purpose
This repository is the java analogue to several other learning repos I have created. I am going to explore Java from a fresh perspective. Despite working with this language from the very start of my 
computer science education, I still feel as if there is a lot to learn.

## Structure
This repository will be split into two parts: *[Project](app/README.md)* and *[Notes](notes/README.md)*. The Project will contain Java code labs while the Notes will contain cheatsheets and deep dives gleaned from research.
